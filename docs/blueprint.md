# **App Name**: Stacks Roll

## Core Features:

- Endless Rolling: Control a glowing white ball rolling down an endless 3D track filled with obstacles. The ball automatically rolls forward, gradually increasing speed over time.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Navigate the ball to avoid randomly generated 3D pillars, rotating bars, and spikes. Collision results in game over.
- Collectibles: Collect floating, glowing Stacks Coins (+10 points) and rare Bitcoin Gems (+100 points) in the 3D environment.
- Dynamic Scoring: Score increases based on coins collected and distance traveled. Display score and "Convert to STX" simulation on the Game Over screen.
- Adaptive Difficulty: The LLM acts as a difficulty scaler tool, continuously adjusting the game's speed and obstacle frequency based on the player's performance. Obstacles adapt by increasing in frequency or velocity depending on the current game stage, all dynamically altered for difficulty.
- Leaderboard Display: Shows the top players, sorted by distance traveled.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant orange (#FFA500) to represent Stacks coins and energy, creating a visual focal point that draws players' attention to collectible rewards.
- Background color: Dark grayish-blue (#222831) providing a dark scheme that contrasts with the vibrant orange and allows the glowing effects to stand out. The desaturated hue ensures that the background doesn't distract from the gameplay.
- Accent color: Purple (#A020F0) is used to highlight interactive elements and provide visual contrast against the orange, enhancing the game's futuristic aesthetic.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, giving a modern, tech-inspired feel to the UI.
- Use glowing icons with rounded corners for all UI elements, following the modern and clean aesthetic.
- Design a minimal and clean interface, using rounded corners and subtle animations to enhance the modern look.
- Implement smooth transitions and subtle animations for the ball movement, coin collection, and UI interactions.
